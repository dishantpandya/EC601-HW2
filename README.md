This is a part of the homework assignment for Boston University's EC601: Procuct Design in ECE.
I have completed three apps: 
1. The Android Starter app
2. A Login and Registration app to learn using firebase authentication using Email and Password.
3. Implemented the firebase tutorial for chat app. This app uses authentication using Google account.
