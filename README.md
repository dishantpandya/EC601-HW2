# EC601-HW2
This is a part of the homework assignment for Boston University's EC601: Procuct Design in ECE.
I have completed three apps: 

1. The Android Starter app.

2. A Login and Registration app to learn using firebase authentication using Email and Password: This app saves the user registration information on firebase. On Logging in, it authenticates a user using the registration information.

3. Implemented the firebase tutorial for chat app by cloning the github tutorial provided. This app uses authentication using Google account.           

4. I've added screenshots of the virtual device with all the activities.

5. Compressed(.rar) project files have been added.
